---------------

This section describes the different system services, which are provided for applications by the Circle :ref:`Libraries`. That defines the Circle API. Only those classes are discussed here, which are directly used by applications. All Circle classes are listed in `doc/classes.txt <https://github.com/rsta2/circle/blob/master/doc/classes.txt>`_.
